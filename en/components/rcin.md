# RC input

Remote control vehicles traditionally include a dedicated link for teleoperating the vehicle. [Erle-brain](https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/erle-brain/) supports traditional RC receiver accepting an PPM-SUM signal. 

Some receivers output 8 separate PWM channels. In that case a PWM to PPM-SUM device can be used to mix all the channel into a single one that should be fed into [Erle-brain](https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/erle-brain/).
